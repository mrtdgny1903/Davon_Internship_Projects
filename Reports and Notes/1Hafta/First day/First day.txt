In this tutorial,

I installed Eclipse and Apache Tomcat(webserver).

Then,I have created a servlet which works as a webpage counter. It tracks the number of visitors of the webpage and persists the number in a text file.

Then,I ran that project on this page http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.web.filecounter/FileCounter

and output is This site has been accessed 1 times.
	      This site has been accessed 2 times.

The servlet will return the number of times it was accessed. If you wait 5 seconds and refresh the browser, the number should increase.
