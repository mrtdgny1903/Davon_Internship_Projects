Redux getting started a baþlandý..

Enforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a clear understanding of what’s going on in the app.
If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened. Finally, to tie state and actions together,
we write a function called a reducer.


State ve action larý baðlamak için reduce adýnda bir fonksiyon kullanýlýyor.
